# far-field-measurement
This is our EE344 - Electronics Design Lab (EDL) project to build an apparatus for far field measurement of optical sources

A physical apparatus has been designed (a couple of pictures of the same are also there in the repository) to measure the far field angular radiation profile of optical sources like LEDs and laser diodes. The repository contains the comprehensive report, presentation, PCB designs, SPICE designs, LabVIEW codes and the final measurements. In addition, the video demonstrating the working of the apparatus can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwXnf3wcw68YSDE1a096Rm54bTg

Thanks!
